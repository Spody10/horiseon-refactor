# Horiseon refactoring code

## Description

Contains a refactored webpage that simplified HTML semantics and combined repetitive CSS classes.

Beginning with HTML, I started by providing proper nav links and changing some of the div elements to elements of proper name representaions.

With the CSS file, there were several classes that repeated the same code, so I combined all like classes to simplify and shorten the code.

Both of these edits were great practice for me to ensure that I am providing clean and consise code in the future. My refactoring is by no means perfect, but with time, patience and practice, I believe my skills will improve.
